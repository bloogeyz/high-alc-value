# High Alchemy Highlight Plugin
This plugin's primary purpose is to quickly show you what items you can safely high alc for profit.
By default it will highlight in green any items in your bank or inventory that have a higher HA value (after deducting 
the cost of a nature rune) than the current average GE value. Additionally, it can be used to show items that can't be 
sold on the GE that have a high alc value above the price of a nature rune.

Please feel free to suggest improvements or fork the project yourself.
